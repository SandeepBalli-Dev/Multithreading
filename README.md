# 🧵 Java Multithreading Mastery – Backend Engineer Roadmap

Welcome to the **Java Multithreading Mastery Series** – a curated set of concepts, code assignments, and real-world patterns designed for backend engineers (2–5 YOE) preparing for **system design**, **performance optimization**, and **technical interviews**.

---

## 📌 Why Learn Multithreading?

Multithreading is the backbone of **scalable backend systems**, enabling:
- Parallel processing
- Non-blocking I/O
- Efficient resource utilization
- Real-time performance
- Resilience in distributed systems

Mastering Java concurrency is essential for writing production-grade services and acing mid-to-senior level interviews.

## 🗂️ Topics You Will Learn

### ✅ Core Java Threading (Foundations)
- Creating threads with `Runnable`, `Thread`, `Callable`
- Thread lifecycle: new, runnable, blocked, waiting, terminated
- Thread joining, sleeping, yielding, and priorities
- Daemon vs user threads

### ✅ Thread Safety and Synchronization
- Race conditions & memory visibility
- `synchronized` keyword
- Intrinsic locks (object monitor)
- ReentrantLock and Lock APIs
- `volatile` keyword
- Thread-safe counters: `AtomicInteger` vs locks

### ✅ Inter-Thread Communication
- `wait()` / `notify()` / `notifyAll()`
- `Condition` and `await/signal`
- Classic Producer-Consumer problem
- Thread coordination with `CountDownLatch`, `CyclicBarrier`, `Semaphore`

### ✅ Executor Framework (Production-grade Concurrency)
- `ExecutorService`, `Executors.newFixedThreadPool`, `newCachedThreadPool`, `newSingleThreadExecutor`
- `Callable` and `Future`
- Scheduled task execution
- Custom `ThreadPoolExecutor` with queue capacity and rejection handling

### ✅ CompletableFuture & Java 8 Async Programming
- Asynchronous pipelines: `thenApply`, `thenCompose`, `thenCombine`
- Error handling: `handle()`, `exceptionally()`, `whenComplete()`
- Async chaining and parallel async tasks
- Real-world use: parallel API calls, microservice orchestration

### ✅ Advanced Thread Pooling
- `ForkJoinPool` & `RecursiveTask`
- Work-Stealing Pool
- Comparison: ForkJoin vs Parallel Streams vs Thread Pools

### ✅ Deadlock, Starvation, and Debugging
- Deadlock creation and prevention
- Lock ordering
- Thread starvation and fairness
- Livelock simulation
- Debugging threads using VisualVM, JConsole, and ThreadMXBean

### ✅ Miscellaneous but Critical
- ThreadLocal and InheritableThreadLocal
- Performance testing using `System.nanoTime()` or JMH
- Reactive patterns with `CompletableFuture` and streams
- Real-world examples: file processing, batch jobs, async logging, timeout-based processing

---

## 🧠 Who This is For

- Java developers with **2–5 years of experience**
- Backend engineers preparing for **interviews, job switch, or system design rounds**
- Developers who want to write **robust, scalable, and parallelizable code**

---

## 🚀 What You'll Build Along the Way

- Thread-safe counter implementations
- Producer-consumer pipelines
- Deadlock simulation and resolution
- Async workflows with `CompletableFuture`
- Custom bounded thread pools
- ForkJoin-based parallel array processors
- Interview-ready explanations and diagrams

---

## 🛠 Tools Used

- Java 8+
- JDK concurrency utilities (`java.util.concurrent`)
- JMH (for benchmarking)
- VisualVM / JConsole (for debugging)
- Notion (for roadmap + checklist)
